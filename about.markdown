# Hi! I'm Preethi
I'm currently a senior at the University of Maryland, College Park where I'm pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Linguistics.

During my time at UMD, I was a part of:
- The Honors Humanities program at UMD's honors college
- PULSAR, the Program for Undergraduate Language Science Ambassadors in Research

I interned with ARLIS, the Applied Research Lab for Intelligence and Security as part of their RISC (Research for Intelligence and Security Challenges) program which pairs students with faculty members at various INSURE institutions and the Department of Defense. I worked in a team of 2 people where we:

- researched how AI and ML could be leveraged to improve the policy-making process within the DoD. 
- read through hundreds of pages of DoD policy and guidelines, 
- interviewed employees at various levels of the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security. 
- summarized findings as well as major solutions we suggested implementing. 
- presented the final report to high level managers at the DoD, as well as to other interns and employees at ARLIS.

Following this internship, I continued my work with ARLIS into the school year as a part of the Critical Technology Protection project. The goal of this project was to create a policy lab environment where the impacts of economic policy could be researched with the end goal being to encourage technological innovation (patents, startups, etc.) within the US. I supported this model with data analysis. In particular, I

- analyzed federal R&D data as well as Pitchbook market data
- researched impacts the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) had on small business
- pulled data from protiviti's annual SOX compliance costs survey
- wrote scripts to pull this data stored on Box

To do this, I specifically used these Python libraries:

- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Pandas
- Polars
- MatplotLib
- Box SDK/API for Python

Currently, I'm a Network intern at OneMain Financial. I'm learning how much of a backbone network security and secure file transport means for a financial company. Being able to work for a large, well-established company like OMF has shown me how much different parts of technology work together and how much there is for me to learn and experience after graduation!

In my free time, I'm teaching myself how to develop apps, and I'm passionate about building interactive, accessible tech. After graduation I'd like to be in a role that allows me to continue learning and programming, whether that's in a data science or research position like I've had before, or a software related position that lets me test out my skills in the tech industry! I love meeting and talking to new people and learning more about what kinds of opportunities I have for my career moving forward, so feel free to reach out at any point.
